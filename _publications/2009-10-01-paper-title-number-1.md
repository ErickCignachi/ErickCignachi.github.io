In the hierarchical structure formation scenario of the ΛCDM cosmology, galaxy groups represent an essential evolutionary stage between isolated galaxies and massive clusters. As environments that host the majority of galaxies, groups are key to understanding both galaxy evolution and dark matter assembly. This work investigates HELMS18, a rare gravitational lens system in which a submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 2.39 is lensed by a foreground structure composed of two aligned galaxy groups at z ≈ 0.6. The system provides a unique opportunity to study galaxy groups in an intermediate stage of hierarchical assembly. Using spectroscopic data from GMOS/Gemini, we identify group members and analyze the stellar kinematics of the two central galaxies – an early-type galaxy and a quasar. Using a two-body model, we estimate that the interaction probability of the groups is 58%. We use ALMA interferometric observations to model the lensing arcs and reconstruct the SMG’s morphology. Lens modeling is performed in the visibility plane using the semi-linear inversion technique, with kinematic measurements used to constrain the priors of a two-component mass model. Each mass component is described by a dual pseudo-isothermal elliptical (dPIE) and a Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profiles.  This joint analysis enables a physically motivated mass model for the lensing groups and mitigates degeneracies in the lens modelling. Our results offer new insights into the internal structure of the lensed SMG and the dynamics of group-scale halos, highlighting the critical role of spectroscopic constraints in improving the accuracy of gravitational lens modelling.
