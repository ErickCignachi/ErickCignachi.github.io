Welcome to my webpage! I’m Érick Cignachi, 24 years old and a master’s student in astrophysics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. My research focuses on strong gravitational lensing, where I combine kinematic constraints with high-resolution observations to overcome well-known degeneracies in lens modeling and explore the complex structure of cosmic components. In particular, I study the lensing effect of a highly dusty galaxy observed when the Universe was just 2.7 billion years old. Using this approach, I can better characterize the lensing object, which we’ve identified as a pair of potentially interacting galaxy groups. By studying this unique system we can provide valuable insights into large-scale structure formation in the early Universe. Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in interferometric observational techniques, their underlying theory, and their potential for high-resolution imaging. My broader research goals revolve around understanding galaxy evolution in the early Universe and large-scale structure formation using multiple observational approaches - including interferometry, single-slit spectroscopy, and IFU data - while also developing new software and methodologies to combine these diverse datasets.

Early in my academic journey, I studied software development at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Sul, where I earned a technical degree in Information Technology (2018). Nevertheless, driven by a love for the Universe and a desire to take on new challenges, I later pursued and completed a BSc in Astrophysics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (2023). My current life goal is to deepen my academic expertise and develop leadership skills that will allow me to make a lasting contribution to the global scientific community, particularly by strengthening research and education in Brazil in the far future.

Outside of research, I enjoy developing software tools for personal projects some of which I may release publicly in the future. One of these is a website for tabletop RPGs, designed to simplify and streamline many of the game’s complex mechanics. I’m also passionate about volleyball, a sport I’ve loved ever since playing on an amateur team in my hometown. Whether I’m playing on the court or cheering from the sidelines, volleyball remains one of my favorite pastimes. Finally, some of my other favorite pastimes include reading, from comics and culture magazines to story-driven books, which keeps me inspired and connected to different perspectives beyond academia.


# How to edit your site's GitHub repository
# ------
# Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or # "Upload files" buttons.
